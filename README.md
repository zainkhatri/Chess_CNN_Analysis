# Artificial Intelligence Optimized Chess Tactics Trainer

A revolutionary chess analytics engine leveraging machine learning, data-driven insights, and real-time evaluation to transform chess training.

## Core Features

### 1. Personalized Opening & Weakness Analysis
* Database Driven Pattern Recognition: Implement a sophisticated relational database to track and analyze individual player habits, historical games, and move patterns to identify strategic tendencies.
* Adaptive Learning System: Deploy advanced pattern recognition algorithms that continuously refine opening recommendations and weakness identification based on player development.
* Dynamic Strategy Adaptation: Utilize reinforcement learning to evolve training recommendations as players improve, ensuring constantly challenging and relevant practice scenarios.

### 2. Stockfish Integration & Validation
* Engine Backed Analysis: Leverage Stockfish's powerful evaluation engine to validate suggested moves and tactical combinations, ensuring high-quality training recommendations.
* Confidence Scoring System: Implement a nuanced weighting system that considers both engine evaluation and positional complexity to provide appropriate challenges for each skill level.

### 3. ELO Rating Prediction System
* Neural Network Analysis: Train a deep learning model on extensive historical data to accurately predict player ratings based on move quality and decision patterns.
* Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics: Consider multiple factors including blunder frequency, positional understanding, and endgame technique to generate accurate rating estimates.

### 4. Advanced Visualization Suite
* Tactical Pattern Heatmaps: Generate detailed visualizations highlighting recurring tactical patterns and common mistakes across multiple games.
* Opening Performance Analytics: Create interactive dashboards showing player performance in specific openings compared to their peer group.
* Endgame Conversion Metrics: Implement sophisticated game theory analysis to evaluate endgame performance and winning position conversion rates.

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 7 (02/18 - 02/22): Data Preprocessing
* Finalize dataset preprocessing (extract chess positions & labels)
* Convert FEN positions into matrix format for CNN input
* Load dataset & perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### Week 8 (02/25 - 02/29): Model Development
* Build initial CNN model (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
* Train model on labeled chess positions
* Evaluate accuracy using Stockfish-suggested moves as ground truth

### Week 9 (03/04 - 03/06): Model Optimization
* Hyperparameter tuning & model improvements (optimizer, layers, dropout)
* Test against Stockfish & compare move accuracy
* Implement a basic blunder detection system

### Week 10 (03/11 - 03/13): Interface & Testing
* (Optional UI) Set up a simple web interface (React.js + Flask)
* (Final Testing) Run AI vs. Stockfish games to assess performance
* Refine model performance & document key insights

### Extra Week (03/07 - 03/14): Finalization
* Polish the final report (NeurIPS/ICML format)
* Prepare submission for Gradescope (Report + Code)
* Buffer time for debugging, last-minute improvements

## Impact

This innovative approach revolutionizes chess training by providing:
* Data driven strategic recommendations tailored to individual playing styles
